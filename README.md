## Wasm Physics
A simple physics engine written in Rust, compiled to WASM and displayed in the browser with some React UI.

### How to Run:
Download the project and run the handy script called "build_and_run" in the root of the directory. \
(.bat for windows, .sh for linux) \
Ensure you have prerequisites installed (e.g. Node). \
A browser tab should open but if not then navigate to the url displayed in the terminal where you ran the script.

### How to Use:
A simple UI is implemented in the top right, adjust values to your liking and click to spawn the object.

##### !NOTE! Resizing your browser window will mess up the clicking and the canvas so refresh after resizing.
